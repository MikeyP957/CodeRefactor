HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Completed Tasks

This is an example of an on-the-job ticket, where I refactor some code. Modifications
I made include adding meaningful comments, identifying and fixing bugs, and
consoildating redundent classes.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, the tech lead had given a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

**Important**: An important rule I try to follow is when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

## Criterea 

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I 
  view the source code
THEN I 
  find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I 
  view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find 
  that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I 
  view the image elements
THEN I find
   accessible alt attributes

WHEN I 
  view the heading attributes
THEN they 
  fall in sequential order
  
WHEN I 
  view the title element
THEN I 
  find a concise, descriptive title
```
